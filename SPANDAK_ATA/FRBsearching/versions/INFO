Pulsar search: active : v3
SP search : active : v2
v4 : Version before the without GPU (no heimdall)
v5:: Version with PRESTO and single_pulse_search.py package.
v6: A good working verion but does not remove zero DM candidates. Next version. 
V7 : With PRESTO, removes zerodm candidates (Next version should have ploting based on the candidate DM and SNR)
V8 : Copy before cleaning and better plotting tool
V9 : Better plot with DM vs SNR plot 
V10: Heimdall command improved with rfi_no_narrow placed 
V11: Heimdall Error check if it fails. ML model passed to FRBcand output for priortization  


PlotCand: active v1
v1: Basic version
v2: With improve diagnostic plot 
v3 : Also with DM vs phase 
v4: Fixed a bug with candidate found at the edge of the file, copied this for next version with negative DM
plots
v5 : Save copy before centing pulse change 
v6: Centering pulse such that we only need to see one plot.(Did not work, very well) (active)
v7: Save before a new version which is to use new python module to plot (without DSPSR and PSRCHIVE). 
v8: New plotting tool which is much better than DSPSR. It centers the pulse along with also providinging other necessary products. 

SPANDAK is a bigger wrapper which will SP_search_BL or other inside
The reason to have a separate wrapper is to do negative DM search enable.
v1: Version which can do both sub-band search and neg-DM but not both together.  
v2: Sub-band using bldice, (save before changing the save to "fil_multidice"
v3: sub-banding using fil_multidice


waterfaller_vg_v1.py : basic
waterfaller_vg_v2.py : DM-vs-time plot uses original data while waterfall and time-series uses downsampled data. 
waterfaller_vg_v3.py : DM-vs-time uses subbanded and downsample data. The zooming on the pulse is fixed to be width*128 bins. 
waterfaller_vg_v4.py : Added on-pulse spectra on the side of the dedisperse waterfall along with a t-test comparison with off-pulse spectra. 
                       Also added DM-vs-SNR for the on-pulse and off-pulse region. The plots are much better. 
    			The only thing I want to add is zoom on the DM-vs-SNR region based on the Cordes and MacLaughlin paper's 
			equation number 13.
waterfaller_vg_v5.py : The output is based on the the three catagories (A, B, C) and others.   		       
waterfaller_vg_v6.py : Two changes (1) scaleing was failing for masked file so instead of using from spectra class, scalling is done
			outside now, (2) based on the number of nbins, polynomial gets removed for each channel.   		
waterfaller_vg_v7.py : Negative DM plotting enabled based on the source name first two letters (e.g. nT,nF,nTnF). _		
waterfaller_vg_v8.py : Off-pulse are taken from the both side of the pulse while earlier it was only from the left half
waterfaller_vg_v9.py : Added csv file option. If --logs <csv file> provided, metadata for each candidate will be stored. 
waterfaller_vg_v10.py : Zap channels with off-pulse signal higher than 4 times the std of the entire spectra. Also zap 5% of the band on both side (top and bottom).
waterfaller_vg_v11.py : Probability from the ML algorithm added. A B C catagory parameters were changed a little bit (this version was used for the first 1000 C band files).
waterfaller_vg_v12.py: All the channels which have 50% zeros in them are flagged. This should reduce number of B candidates
